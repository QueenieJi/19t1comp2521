Notes (what the above indicates):

1. Different method does not affect much when the data is random. That could because 
that there is only one data and the tests cases are not big enough. If there are
enough tests and data, the efficiency difference might be obvious.

2. Generally, the AVL approach is the most effective method. The reason for that 
is AVL approach repair balance locally as soon as an imbalance is noticed. Hence
it does not need to compare with all the values through the tree.

3. There is a huge difference between ascending order and prefix order when using
the L method. That is because L need to add new values into the leaves, but to do
this with acsending order will generate a tree with only one branch and each time
 insert a new node, it needs to compare through the tree. Hence the Depth of the
tree is the total number of nodes.

4. The splay tree gets the depth of 5000 in both acsending order and prefix order
because it does not require balance.
